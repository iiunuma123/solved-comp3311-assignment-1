– Mapping ER Designs to SQL– grade : 11.8/12– https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3311/20T3/assignments/ass1/index.php

## Goal:The aim of this assignment is to take a given ER design and convert it to a database schema expressed in the SQL data definition language. In some sense, this comes in part-way through the database development process; you would nomally start with requirements and develop an ER model and then convert it to SQL. We have done the first bit for you.

This assignment is worth a total of 12 marks. You will be assessed automatically (with scope for manual override) according to how completely and accurately your SQL schema translates the ER design. Part of “accuracy” involves following the naming conventions we give below (under Your Task). Please try to restrain your boundless creativity and use the naming scheme that we suggest. There are other rules for the translation in Your Task apart from naming; please follow these as well.
